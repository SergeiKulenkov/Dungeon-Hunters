Finally published all the code from my game Dungeon Hunters that I finished making in August 2023. (https://talesofunreal.itch.io/dungeon-hunters)

While developing I used Unity's Plastic version control, but I couldn't find a way to import the repository from there, so there's no commit history here.

Here are only C# code files, because I don't want to publish sprites and audio files that I didn't make.

Project folder structure is visible in gitignore file.
